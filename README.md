The HeapPQEntry object, P priority object, and E data object were all written by the WashU Data Structures and Algorithms teaching team.

In this project I implemented essential functions such as bubbleUp and bubbleDown to maintain the heap property of a min heap, allowing functions such as insert and remove to function correctly.
In the test-cases-and-complexity text document, I also provide test cases, a complexity analysis, and data collected from running different input sizes to show that the complexity analysis is correct.
